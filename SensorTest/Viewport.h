/* This class provides a mechanism to map a portion of 
 * the physics world (meters) to the screen (pixels).
 *
 * To keep operations on the viewport size easy to manage,
 * the concept of "scale" is used instead of directly 
 * requesting dimensions of the viewport.  The viewport is
 * always a scale factor of the pixel dimensions of the 
 * screen.
 *

 *
 * The Viewport does not exist and work by itself, 
 * it uses the Notitifer to let others know when the 
 * viewport has changed.  Currently, it only emits
 * an NE_VIEWPORT_CHANGED notification, but it could
 * also emit different notifications for scale vs.
 * center changes.  
 *
 * This can be used to change presentation (e.g. 
 * level of detail) based on the changes in scale.
 *
 * Currently, it is used to update the position of
 * a displayed "grid" over the screen.  This grid
 * gives the user the perception of "distance" and
 * scale like a parallax view, but in two dimensions.
