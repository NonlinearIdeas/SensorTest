/* This template implements is designed to be used as the 
 * base class for a singleton.  
 *
 * The life cycle of objects derived from this class is very 
 * specific:
 * 1. The constructor does NOTHING.
 * 2. The Init() function is called from your application before
 *    using the class.  This is where all the REAL initialization 
 *    is done.  This allows you to control the order that the 
 *    initialization for multiple singletons are executed.
 * 3. Use the singleton...
 * 4. Call Reset() as needed to return it to the ground state.
 *    You may need to call Init() again depending on your needs.
 * 5. Call Shutdown() when you exit the Application to clean 
 *    up.
 *
 * While the implementation in this class is relatively small, the
 * goal is to design a policy for using the a singleton.  That is 
 * to say, lazy initialization is nice but carries complexities,
 * especially in threaded environments.  It's easier to have an 
 * explicit initialaztion as part of the system so that any
 * complex dependencies can be resolved by the order of 
 * execution of the initialization.
