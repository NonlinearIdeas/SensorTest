/*
 The Notifier is a singleton implementation of the Subject/Observer design
 pattern.  Any class/instance which wishes to participate as an observer
 of an event can derive from the Notified base class and register itself
 with the Notiifer for enumerated events.
 
 Notifier derived classes MUST implement the notify function, which has
 a prototype of:
 
 void Notify(const NOTIFIED_EVENT_TYPE_T& event)
 
 This is a data object passed from the Notifier class.  The structure
 passed has a void* in it.  There is no illusion of type safety here
 and it is the responsibility of the user to ensure it is cast properly.
 In most cases, it will be "NULL".
 
 Classes derived from Notified do not need to deregister (though it may
 be a good idea to do so) as the base class destrctor will attempt to
 remove itself from the Notifier system automatically.
 
 The event type is an enumeration and not a string as it is in many
 "generic" notification systems.  In practical use, this is for a closed
 application where the messages will be known at compile time.  This allows
 us to increase the speed of the delivery by NOT having a
 dictionary keyed lookup mechanism.  Some loss of generality is implied
 by this.
 
 This class/system is NOT thread safe, but could be made so with some
 mutex wrappers.  It is safe to call Attach/Detach as a consequence
 of calling Notify(...).
